# cookie-clicker-cheat-scripts
Just some scripts I made for cookie clicker.

## How to use
You can use these by copying the scripts and either pasting them into the console, you can paste them into the URL bar, or if you know what bookmarklets are you can put it into a bookmark and change the link to the code.

Do know that if you want to use a script from the scripts folder (not the betterScripts folder) again you have to refresh.

## Advice
I suggest you go in the settings and make a backup save if you are currently on a save you don't wanna accidentaly break, or want to go back to at some point.

## Game issues?
If you are having issues with your game such as the counter being infinity and not being able to get cookies or buy things. If that happens try refreshing, and if that doesn't work you can load a backup save, and if you don't have a backup you might have to wipe your save in the settings.

Report an issue if something breaks and save wiping/loading doesn't work.

## Another possible way to use
I was thinking about putting this into a script that would add a menu for using these scripts quicker.
